# Zyfra_Gold_Mining_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Project
Zyfra is a gold ore company that is in need of a machine learning model to predict how much gold can be recovered from a gold ore.

## Introduction: 

In this project, we are creating a machine learning model for the company Zyfra. The company creates efficient solutions for heavy industry. The model will predict how much gold can be recovered from a gold ore. The model's goal is to aid the optimization of production and the elimination of unprofitable parameters.

## Datasets
- gold_recovery_train.csv
- gold_recovery_test.csv
- gold_recovery_full.csv

## Conclusion
The Final sMAPE for the Random Forest model is 7.9142%, indicating a slightly more accurate predictive capability compared to the constant model, which yielded a Final sMAPE of 7.9496%.

Although the difference in sMAPE between the models is small, the Random Forest model does show a minor improvement, suggesting it captures some underlying patterns in the data that a naive prediction does not.

In summary, the project has successfully built a predictive model for gold recovery rates, but with room for refinement. The current model provides a baseline for future enhancements and offers valuable insights for improving predictive accuracy in similar industrial processes.
